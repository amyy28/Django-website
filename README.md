# My Django_Website :website:

A complete and fully implementable software for a company to ease out the work of HR's. Now no need to maintain huge excel sheets to store information about fields like candidates, companies, job openings and stuff. Every thing is made easier through create, update and delete forms and the data is displayed in the form of tables from the database. The data can also be uploaded through csv files. Different privileges are given to the admin and staff users. The website also has a unique tracker for each logged in user where the person can keep track, schedule interviews and send auto-generated emails to his/her respective candidates.
